PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn. It uses the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains 569 instances of tumor samples characterized by 30 numeric features such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on these features. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, after which the model is trained to learn patterns in the data. After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy score, classification report (including precision, recall, and F1-score), and a confusion matrix. Visualizations such as the confusion matrix heatmap and the top 10 most important features provide deeper insight into the model's decision-making. The Random Forest model achieves high accuracy, making it suitable for aiding early diagnosis. Additional enhancements include saving the trained model using Joblib and testing predictions on new data samples. Overall, the project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used in medical diagnosis tasks to support clinical decision-making.
